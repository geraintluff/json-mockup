json-mockup
===========

Mock up a JSON API for demo purposes (PHP, with planned Node support)

Basically, the config file contains a series of rules (e.g. URI Templates to match, query parameters, request method) and then hard-code a response.

There's even some very rudimentary state, which can allow you to simulate interactivity.

Have a look at `config.json` to see how it works, or extract it yourself, and navigate to `/demo.php/intro/`.
